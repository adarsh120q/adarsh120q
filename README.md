## 🧠 About Me

I'm a self-driven developer focused on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. I love experimenting with cutting-edge technologies and building intelligent systems — from intent-based chatbots to generative medical tools.

Currently working on Medibot (a generative AI-powered medical assistant) and Prajna (an intelligent NLP chatbot). I enjoy open-source contributions, coding challenges, and learning through building.
